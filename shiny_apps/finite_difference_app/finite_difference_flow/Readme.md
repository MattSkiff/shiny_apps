This small shiny app is an interactive demonstration of a simple "block behind the dam" hydrological flow model. The top and left hand edge of the matrix are fixed head cells, right hand and bottom edge of the matrix are boundary cells and the middle is comprised of interior cells. The bottom right hand corner (in the visualisation, left hand corner in the matrices displayed in the tabs and used in calculations) is a fixed head cell, representing a "crack" in the damn with water flowing through to the lower lake level.

This app is adapted from an interactive spreadsheet demonstration for EARTH331-2019 created by Associate Professor Earl Bardsley of the Faculty of Science and Engineering at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.

For anyone with more hydrological chops than I, here is a direct quote from Associate Professor Earl Bardsley explaining the model directly: "...shows a cross section through an impermeable concrete dam (shaded) with a 9x9 metre block of supporting permeable material behind. There is a steady rate of leakage through this block from the upstream lake, discharging finally though a horizontal crack extending along the base of the dam. The block is sitting on an impermeable lower rock unit. So you have a mix of zero flow boundaries and constant head boundaries. The upper lake level is at 15 metres, and the lower lake at 1.5 metres."

So, with the addition of top and side boundaries, the 9x9 metre block becomes a 10x10 grid and the upper and lower lake levels are adjustable parameters in the app above.

Have fun!
