* Make sure screen resolution is 1920x1080

* Past 5k points, plot of circle + points will not render (speeds up response considerably)

--------------------------------

* loop will continue once clicked until paused. It's on a 2s delay, during which no computation takes place, which is complicated by the subsequent time to simulate and render points - it's not particulary sophisticated in terms of timing in that respect
